      This account is for managing your everyday expenses and bills.<br>

  PLAY money is spent every month on purchases you wouldn’t normally<br>
      make. The purpose of this jar is to nurture yourself. You could purchase<br>
      an expensive bottle of wine at dinner, get a massage or go on a<br>
      weekend getaway. Play can be anything your heart desires. You and a<br>
      spouse can each receive your own play money, and not even ask what<br>
    the other person spends it on!</span></td>

      This is your golden goose. This jar is your ticket to financial freedom.<br>
      The money that you put into this jar is used for investments and building<br>
      your passive income streams. You never spend this money.<br>
      The only time you would spend this money is once you become financially<br>
      free. Even then you would only spend the returns on your investment.<br>
    Never spend the principal.</span></td>

      Money in this jar is meant to further your education and personal<br>
      growth. An investment in yourself is a great way to use your money.<br>
      You are your most valuable asset. Never forget this.<br>
      Education money can be used to purchase books, CD’s, courses or<br>
    anything else that has educational value.</span></td>

      Money in this jar is for bigger, nice-to-have purchases. Use the money<br>
      for vacations, extravagances, a plasma TV, contingency fund, your<br>
      children's education etc. A small monthly contribution can go a long<br>
      way. You may have more than one LTS jar. If you have more than one<br>
    LTS, divide the 10% between the jars according to your priorities.</span></td>

      Money in this jar is for giving away. Use the money for family and<br>
      friends on birthdays, special occasions and holidays. You can also give<br>
      away your time as opposed to giving away money. You could house sit<br>
      for a neighbor, take a friend’s dog for a walk or volunteer in your<br>
    community or for your favorite charity.</span></td>
